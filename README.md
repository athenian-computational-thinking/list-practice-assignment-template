# List practice assignment

## Problem Description
in this assignment, you will practice some of the basic commands to work with lists.

You will be given a list to start: starter_list = [3, 18, 2, 75, 8, 33]
* Append 123 to the list 
  *  Example: `list.append(15)` adds 15 to the end of `list`
* Insert 12 into the list[2] spot 
  * Example: `list.insert(1, 'athenian')` inserts `athenian` in the #1 spot
* Remove 8 from the list 
  * Example: `list.remove('ball')` removes the string `'ball'` from the list
* Sort list in ascending order (smallest to largest)
  * Example: `list.sort()` sorts from small to large, `list.sort(reverse = True)` sorts large to small 
* Check if 33 is in the list
  * Hint: use the keyword `in`! 

Note: Read the comments in `my_code.py` for more instructions!
